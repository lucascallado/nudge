## October 10, 2016 --- 1st. Place Winner for Human Social Connection
This project is applying Augmented Reality [Wikipedia AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)

## Inspiration
We were inspired by how AR (particularly in Pokemon Go) started organic conversations, brought people together and created communities.

## What it does
It allows users to scan other users and figure out mutual interests to organically start conversations.

## How we built it
We used Unity, CSharp, Microsoft-Cognitive-Services, and Vuforia.

## Challenges we ran into
The act of actually mapping something next to a face proved to be something more difficult than anticipated.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We've managed to accomplish facial tracking on the Tango --- Adroid mobile devices.

## What's next for Nudge
Ideally, this would eventually recognize individual faces instead just sensing when there's a face in front of the camera. This would allow customization with the different graphics. Nudge could ideally become a more interactive experience with more motion instead of tracking static images. With technological processing advances, the tracking would also ideally be more immediate.

## Built With
unity
microsoft-cognitive-services
vuforia
